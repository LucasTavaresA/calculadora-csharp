#+TITLE: Csharp calculator

Calculates operations and show results in the terminal

*Project made to practice, i do not recomend, use [[https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bc_(linguagem_de_programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o)][bc]] instead*

Capable of making multiple calculations reading lines of a file using: =Program file.txt=

Capable of receiving calculations directly using: =Program 1 + 1= in the terminal¹

Avoid the limitations of calculating in the terminal by using the program that will ask for the calculus

* Limitações

1. *In the terminal* especial characters of your shell must be escaped by using =\= that being =1 \* 2=, *Varies from shell to shell*

2. In all methods there's no order of operations and no parenthesis support

3. Because of csharp this method is too slow taking and average of *0.33s to 0.28s* to solve 100 calculations of a file, In comparison with [[https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bc_(linguagem_de_programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o)][bc]] that takes an average of *0.005s to 0.003s*, Cause is made in c language

* TO DO

- Organize the order of operations and parenthesis

* Files

- contas.txt file to test
